# BLOOD BANK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

## Getting Started
Project made as part of VTU 5th sem ISE DBMS mini project. The goal was just to demonstrate the database structure for the blood bank. The project does not meant to use in a real web server. It does not provide much security systems as well. 


### Project File Structure

`database` -  This folder contains a database file which can be used to setup the database.

`docs/` - Contains the document files of the project.The docs may not represent the exact behaviour or fearures of the project. Because as upgrades are made on the project there is no guarantee that the same will be reflected on the docs.

`res/` - Contains the resources used in the project such as images, fonts, icons etc.

### Installation

#### 1.create the database
Create a database in your local server with a name blood_bank.

#### 2.import the database 
import the .db file present in the database folder.

#### 3.run the application
if you are running the project locally, the project folder should be placed in the directory that the Apache web server looks for files to serve on your domain by default. Most probably the `htdocs` folder. After that run the application just by using the url `localhost/blood-bank`.
